[23:07:54] [foxbot#0282] why is it dead
[23:07:56] [foxbot#0282] just plug it in
[23:07:56] [Kisei#7840] check that baby out
[23:07:58] [foxbot#0282] and turn it on
[23:07:58] [Concerned Hobbit#9354] And other commands should work, too
[23:07:59] [foxbot#0282] ??
[23:08:01] [Concerned Hobbit#9354] _test
[23:08:03] [dec#8306] you can just .reply to a IMessage
[23:08:06] [??#9976] wow 2 tutorials in one day th
[23:08:07] [Fuyu#0588] maybe it got wind of java and keeled over
[23:08:07] [??#9976] x
[23:08:15] [Archangelx#4259] ... I mean like game server. The communty is dying ;-;
[23:08:16] [Lucky_Evie#4611] Still just javascript not node.js. Nodebeginner is a little more... specific
[23:08:20] [Connor68989#2359] https://gyazo.com/0335db56eb0de8c25a1a595f1f52fa4a
[23:08:23] [gdude2002#5318] oh, I've been there
[23:08:24] [Lucky_Evie#4611] Though it's based on making a website.
[23:08:26] [Minn#6688] Can't believe you got that garbage running
[23:08:28] [Fuyu#0588] what game
[23:08:30] [Minn#6688] Ohhhh
[23:08:32] [gdude2002#5318] minecraft?>
[23:08:32] [Archangelx#4259] Vainglory ;-;
[23:08:34] [Kisei#7840] node js is life
[23:08:34] [Archangelx#4259] no...
[23:08:35] [Fuyu#0588] what
[23:08:37] [Archangelx#4259] what
[23:08:39] [?? PikaPi ??#5870] what
[23:08:40] [Minn#6688] Makes sense
[23:08:41] [Roy#4890] I mean to use the Name of the sender inside a message that it looks like @dec
[23:08:41] [Fuyu#0588] what
[23:08:46] [Minn#6688] should be an easy fix
[23:08:47] [?? PikaPi ??#5870] what what waht
[23:08:47] [Connor68989#2359] i like getting things to run.
[23:08:50] [gdude2002#5318] oh, it's a touch-based moba
[23:08:52] [Archangelx#4259] Vainglory is a mobile MOBA (it's actually realy good)
[23:08:52] [Panda#7924] `IUser#mention`
[23:08:53] [??#9976] but i just want to make a bot
[23:09:00] [Fuyu#0588] moba
[23:09:01] [Fuyu#0588] ew
[23:09:04] [Connor68989#2359] it was, all i had to to was add .toString()
[23:09:05] [gdude2002#5318] not exactly a good target market for a community
[23:09:07] [??#9976] i want to be able to grab first image from google search from user input
[23:09:09] [Archangelx#4259] Moba... is like runescape...
[23:09:11] [Minn#6688] tbh the version on github was probably better than my local one
[23:09:12] [dec#8306] ?
[23:09:13] [Lucky_Evie#4611] @Chloe there is not tutorial that will specifically help you write exactly the bot that you want to write.
[23:09:13] [??#9976] and do those kind of cool things
[23:09:16] [Archangelx#4259] but shorter
[23:09:17] [Minn#6688] where i tried to fix it
[23:09:19] [?? PikaPi ??#5870] like LoL
[23:09:20] [gdude2002#5318] no, that's mmorpg
[23:09:22] [Minn#6688] but broke it in the end
[23:09:23] [Lucky_Evie#4611] ?ahh help
[23:09:26] [gdude2002#5318] LoL or DOTA or Smite are MOBAs
[23:09:29] [Lucky_Evie#4611] That's how you make a bot.
[23:09:33] [gdude2002#5318] multiplayer online battle arena
[23:09:34] [?? PikaPi ??#5870] yu[
[23:09:34] [Connor68989#2359] >=say Ello Lads! im back
[23:09:37] [??#9976] Failed at step 1
[23:09:40] [Archangelx#4259] Think about it... you farm, get money, buy items, and pvp.
[23:09:43] [Kisei#7840] to make a bot you need to be the bot
[23:09:43] [acdenisSK ? ?#5503] i call my code cancer even if it does look perfect http://goo.gl/mrZ7e2
[23:09:49] [??#9976] WOW
[23:09:51] [Archangelx#4259] and level up ^
[23:09:51] [OllysCoding#4627] But in Unity, you would NEVER have everything in one file, so why would you do that to an API for unity? ?
[23:09:52] [?? PikaPi ??#5870] so it's MMORPG
[23:09:53] [gdude2002#5318] all at the same time
[23:09:55] [?? PikaPi ??#5870] not MOBA
[23:09:56] [Crowdhopper#2459] You could say you tried to Minn-d it.
[23:09:58] [Archangelx#4259] ikr lol
[23:09:58] [gdude2002#5318] it's very condensed
[23:09:59] [Lucky_Evie#4611] oooooh that's nice.
[23:10:00] [Kisei#7840] `let`
[23:10:00] [gdude2002#5318] no, it's definitely a moba
[23:10:05] [Connor68989#2359] badum tsch
[23:10:10] [gdude2002#5318] it is massively multiplayer, online, and an rpg
[23:10:10] [??#9976] that doesn't remotely look like my stuff
[23:10:14] [sponges#9409] m
[23:10:14] [gdude2002#5318] moba is a subgenre
[23:10:17] [acdenisSK ? ?#5503] that's mine
[23:10:20] [Lucky_Evie#4611] It's just a big string....
[23:10:20] [acdenisSK ? ?#5503] my system
[23:10:22] [Kisei#7840] its simple and clean
[23:10:23] [acdenisSK ? ?#5503] my thoughts
[23:10:23] [Lucky_Evie#4611] like... easy
[23:10:24] [?? PikaPi ??#5870] oh i didn't know sry
[23:10:26] [Kisei#7840] but a big ass string
[23:10:27] [Archangelx#4259] Vainglory is actually reviewed by MMO-Hut.
[23:10:33] [Minn#6688] So, how is the whole brexit thing going for ya? I think you were british
[23:10:41] [Connor68989#2359] i am.
[23:10:45] [gdude2002#5318] they review like everything
[23:10:47] [Lucky_Evie#4611] I mean sure there's map() and filter() in there, that makes it a little more than "just a string" ?
[23:10:48] [??#9976] ur stuff is cooler
[23:10:51] [Kisei#7840] just make an array and push everything in
[23:10:57] [Minn#6688] Heard about the protests
[23:10:57] [giggybyte#8273] @gdude.py figured out my stupid issue. i was splitting a string incorrectly because i forgot newline characters varied per OS
[23:10:59] [Archangelx#4259] I though tit was only for like MMO stuff?
[23:11:00] [Kisei#7840] that's what i do XD
[23:11:06] [Lucky_Evie#4611] string concat is more performance than array.
[23:11:07] [Minn#6688] Seems like they are upset about not voting
[23:11:09] [gdude2002#5318] @giggybyte are you using perl?
[23:11:10] [gdude2002#5318] :P
[23:11:12] [Lucky_Evie#4611] I think
[23:11:12] [acdenisSK ? ?#5503] ^
[23:11:17] [gdude2002#5318] @Archangelx did you read what I said?
[23:11:17] [Archangelx#4259] I code games with RPG maker because I'm incompetent.
[23:11:22] [Connor68989#2359] imma just move to scotland when they go independant and go back into the eu ?
[23:11:27] [giggybyte#8273] @gdude.py c#, but instead of using \r\n i was using \n alone
[23:11:28] [sponges#9409] !
[23:11:31] [Minn#6688] That's the spirit
[23:11:31] [Kisei#7840] i know i know i should stop tbh
[23:11:34] [Fuyu#0588] @<spong::&boy(DontFCKingmentionMe
[23:11:37] [sponges#9409] AAAAAAAAAAAAAA
[23:11:42] [Minn#6688] If you're still able to move ?
[23:11:45] [gdude2002#5318] @<spong::&boy(DontFCKingmentionMe
[23:11:48] [Archangelx#4259] @gdude.py my mistake. I assumed that you didn't know because you know... most people don't know.
[23:11:50] [sponges#9409] DOntuKFIckmMENitomE
[23:11:51] [Minn#6688] Who knows what will change
[23:11:51] [?? PikaPi ??#5870] i use \n alone too but only because i use linux only :v
[23:11:51] [giggybyte#8273] ho boy here we go again
[23:11:51] [gdude2002#5318] @<spong::&boy(DontFCKingmentionMe ah, okay
[23:11:58] [gdude2002#5318] @Archangelx been here for years

[23:14:27] [Archangelx#4259] but low battery .-.
